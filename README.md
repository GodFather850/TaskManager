# ✅ CLI-Task Manager – by CAgent_47 (V1.3)


A simple but powerful task manager built with Python and tkinter.
It works offline, saves tasks in a .txt file, and keeps your shit organized — because who has time to remember everything?

## 🔧 What it does  

- ➕ Add a task — it automatically adds a timestamp  
- 🧾 Shows all tasks in a clean list  
- 🗑️ Delete everything at once (but first, it asks: “Are you sure?”)  
- ⚠️ No empty tasks allowed — because that’s just浪费时间  

## 📁 How it saves tasks  

Tasks are saved in a simple `config.json` file like this:

Maximum Task = 100
if tasks equal 100:
```python
def deleteAllTask():
    if os.path.exists(configuration):
        result = input('Are you sure you want to delete ALL tasks? (y/n): ')
        if result.lower() == 'y':
            with open(configuration, 'w') as f:
                json.dump([], f, indent=4)
            print("All tasks deleted.")
            return True
        else:
            print("Deletion cancelled.")
            return False
    return False

print("ERROR: Maximum tasks reached!")
if deleteAllTask():
    task_list = []
```
**Note:** 
*This function is responsible for managing so that the number of tasks does not increase to the point where it slows down the execution of the program.*
